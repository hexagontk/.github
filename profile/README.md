### Hexagon Organization
The Hexagon organization hosts Hexagon Toolkit's repositories and other developer tools made with
the toolkit.

The main toolkit functionalities are located in the [hexagon] repository, while accessory libraries
can be found in the [hexagon_extra] repository.

Other tools created with the toolkit will be held on their own repositories.

Inside this organization's repositories, you can also find examples (i.e.: [real_world]), templates
(as [gradle_starter]) and tools.
